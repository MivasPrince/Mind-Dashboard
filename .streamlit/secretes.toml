Ethiopian Airlines utilizes dynamic pricing to adjust ticket prices in real time based on demand, seat availability, and other factors.\n\nGiven the airline's recent shift towards cargo operations and the volatility in fuel prices, how should Ethiopian Airlines adapt its dynamic pricing algorithms to optimize revenue, while maintaining customer trust and dealing with unpredictable demand?\n"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "message": "I would say one of the ways that Ethiopian Airlines could react to a situation like that is by actually using machine learning opportunities to decide what the prices should be. For example, I'd keep the core engine built, but I'd recalibrate it around profit, uncertainty and trust guardrails and explicitly connect passenger pricing to cargo capacity decisions. I would also shift the optimization targets from revenue to profit, contribute under-fuel volatility as well. Instead of optimizing fair revenue, I'd optimize expected contribution margins per seat. So the objective would be to establish price minus variable costs, and I would also adjust that to expected demands where variable cost includes fuel sensitive components. I'll use fuel scenarios, I'll have like three cohorts of that, base scenarios, high scenarios, and extreme high scenarios, and I'll adjust minimum acceptable fare by route and aircraft type so that we don't sell volume at a loss during fuel spikes. I'd also upgrade demand forecasting for unpredictability and distribution, not point estimates. So these are some of the strategies I would use to set that."
    },
    {
      "role": "agent",
      "message": "That's a very comprehensive approach. I appreciate the way you're thinking about recalibrating the dynamic pricing engine around profit, uncertainty, and trust.\n\nHow would you specifically incorporate the \"trust guardrails\" into the machine learning model to ensure ethical pricing during economic hardship, and what metrics would you use to measure customer perception of fairness?\n"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "message": "Okay, I think one of the ways I would implement trust guardrails is to ensure that when compared to the prices of other service providers, I would make sure that as hard constraints and monitored fairness objectives, I'd wrap all of these around machine learning models so that the model can still optimize, but only inside an ethical and reputationally safe envelope. How would I make these guardrails work within an ML-driven pricing system? The first thing I want to do is to constrain optimization layers. I would have model proposes guardrails and an approval system. I would let the machine learning model output a recommended price or demand curve, and I would also consider the willingness of the customers to pay. Then, I'll pass it through a policy constraint layer before publishing. I will be looking at rate of change cap, example price cannot increase more than X percentage within Y hours or days for the same route class under a defined disruption trigger. I would also set a price floor or ceiling. This would allow the price of the tickets to be banded within a maximum and minimum limit. And I'll also implement and invert event-based hardship mode when macro stress indicators are triggered. For example, if there's sharp damage to your equipment, you can use this method to reduce your risk of getting hit by an accident. If there's sharp inflation, fuel spikes and national emergencies, I would have my price adjust accordingly. I would also ensure that there's a fairness awareness loss function and I would have a regularization of soft constraints. Where we have reliable segment data, we can also include a penalty term that discourages systematically harsher outcomes for vulnerable groups or marks. I would also introduce a human in the loop for edge cases. So this would actually ensure that where edge cases do occur, the human can actually look at it on a case-by-case basis and correct as necessary. Yeah?"

    {
      "role": "agent",
      "message": "That's a very detailed and thoughtful approach to incorporating trust guardrails. You've clearly considered various aspects of ethical pricing and customer perception.\n\nGiven these guardrails, how would you balance the need to maintain profitability with the potential for revenue loss due to these constraints, especially in highly competitive markets where other airlines may not have similar ethical considerations?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "message": "Yeah, I wouldn't want to. I would definitely consider situations where profitability is important because that's what the business is set up for. I would have to quantify the trade-off optimisation where long-term profit and not just today's yield is considered. I would measure profitability as short-term contribution as a margin per route or segment plus expected lifetime value impact. So what this means is that I'm optimising for repeat purchase, loyalty retention, brand trust and proxies. If price spikes creates short-term revenue but increases abandonment, complaints or churn, it's usually a net negative over time and that will be deprioritised. I'll prioritise cases where there is indeed need to increase price because probably the competitors are also increasing their prices and this wouldn't seem to be an aggressive plan to take advantage of the customers but genuinely responding to market needs at the moment."

      "role": "agent",
      "message": "That's a very insightful perspective on balancing profitability with long-term customer value. It's crucial to consider the lifetime value impact of pricing decisions.\n\nConsidering the competitive landscape with Kenya Airways, how should Ethiopian Airlines' pricing strategy adapt if Kenya Airways achieves its turnaround goals and becomes a more formidable competitor in the region?\n"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "message": "Yeah, if Kenya Airways becomes a more formidable competition in the area, what I would be looking at is to take advantage of turnaround projects. So I would move from generic dynamic pricing to competitive intelligence pricing. I would upgrade the price engine so it reacts not just to internal demand inventory, but also to competitor-free fair moves. Things like routes, taking advantage of routes and advanced purchases, competitor capacity changes, frequency and aircraft gauge, new routes. I would also look at service quality signals, on-time performance cancellations, where price sensitivity changes with reliability. I would also implement segment defense. I'm not going to fight every customer with the same weapon. For business and time-sensitive travelers, who would obviously prioritize time and other considerations over price, I would look at integrating loyalty benefits, price matching only selectively. For leisure cases, I would also be highly elastic with the travelers, where I will compete with fenced rule-based fares. And for transit passengers or hop competition, I would defend these with connection quality. So this is how I would approach it. Yeah, different cases, different strokes for different folks essentially."
